# Java-Git-Playground
Don't pay attention to this. It's too random to matter
Buuuuuuut.... If you do pay attention to this, keep reading.
# Introduction
Seriously, unless you are really sure you mean to, **don't pay any attention to this repo**. It is meaningless. It is just a little playground I set up to screw around with the only real Java I know. If you want to contribute (maybe to the wiki, or to my own Java knowledge), ask me. I *might* say yes (probably not though).
# Explanation
I literally set this up as my first real repository. The only one with actual compile-able code in it. It is ~~totally important~~ completely irrelevant in every way.
# Help
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/geekkid1/Java-Git-Playground/wiki). Go ahead. I'll wait. ... ... ... ...  Back already? Yeah, I know. Really, I'm sure you don't want to pay attention to this.
